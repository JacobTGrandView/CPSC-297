Describe mutable and immutable values and give examples.


Immutable means it can't be changed

Ex: let myString = 'Testing'; //this string can't be changed
    myString.toUpperCase(); //this returns 'TESTING' but doesn't change the myString variable to 'TESTING'



Mutable means it can be changed

Ex: let x = [1, 2, 3];
    x[3] = 4; //adds the number 4 to the array
