Describe primitive and object types in JavaScript. Give examples of each.


Primitive: Primitive values include numbers, strings, booleans, a symbol, null or undefined.
	   Primitive types can't be changed, they are immutable. 
	   Ex: let myNumber = 3; //this is primitive type

Object: Object types can be changed, they are mutable. These include the ones not included above.
	Primitive data types are passed by value, object types are passed by reference.
	Ex: let this_thing = {name: "Jacob"}; //this is an object type
